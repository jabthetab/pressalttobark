# Press Alt to Bark: A fork of "Press Alt To Meow"

The recently published Game [Stray](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1332010/Stray/) has a dedicated meow button.
Why doesn't Minecraft have one too?

Well, Mari023 added one! And then I replaced it with a bark button because I'm a traitor to my species.

If only the client has this mod installed, only the client will hear the sound
If it is installed on the server too, all other players in range will hear the sound too (even when they don't have the mod installed)
